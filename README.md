# RPS Project

The RPS Project, aka the 'Rock, Paper, Scissors' project, is the first project in the Odin Project's JavaScript(ES) curriculum.
This project will take the learned knowledge of the first few segments of the Odin Project and apply the knowledge.
The first few segments covered the basics of Javascript and will be the primary language this project will be written in.
Subjects included, but not limited to, strings, booleans, variables, constants, switch statements, if/else statements, functions, and so on.
This project will also incorporate the knowledge learned from HTML and CSS.

I struggled with this project a lot. It took me a lot longer to grasp JavaScript concepts than HTML and CSS. I breezed through the HTML and CSS portion of the Odin Project since I had some prior experience when I was younger. This project showed me how much I really understood about coding in general, which is to say that it wasn't a lot. There were times that I was stuck on one portion of this project for days, or frustrated because I didn't understand what I was doing wrong. Alas, I persevered and continued to work on it bit by bit. Once the code was done and did what I told it to do the feeling of accomplishing and completing this project was just pure satisfaction with myself.

I also learned a bit of Bootstrap. It made styling much easier but it was only to get my feet wet with what it really is and how it can be incorporated in code.
