# Project-RPS

The RPS Project, aka the 'Rock, Paper, Scissors' project, is the first project in the Odin Project's curriculum. This project will take the learned knowledge of the first few segments of the Odin Project and apply the knowledge. The first few segments covered the basics of Javascript and will be the primary language this project will be written in. Subjects included, but not limited to, strings, booleans, variables, constants, switch statements, else if statements, functions, and so on.
